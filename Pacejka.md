Hans B. Pacejka (1934-2017), who was a teacher at Delft University of Technology (Netherlands), has contributed to many major articles related to tire modelling in vehicle dynamics. He set the bases for a tire model which is now used in the whole automotive industry and named after him.

This model allows to compute the forces delivered by a tire during cornering, braking and acceleration. It doesn't rely upon any physical assumption : it is "only" an empirical model using dozens of parameters, which must be fit with measurements. This is why Pacejka's model is called *Magic Formula*
